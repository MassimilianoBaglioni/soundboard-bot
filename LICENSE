                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) [2024]  [Massimiliano Baglioni]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other
practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License
for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  To understand the concept, you should think of free as in
"free speech," not as in "free beer."

The GPL grants you the following freedoms:
1. The freedom to use the program for any purpose.
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do
   what you wish.  Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies of the program so you can help others.
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
   By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit
   from your changes.  Access to the source code is a precondition for
   this.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prohibit
distributors from denying you these freedoms or asking you to surrender
these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the software, you must pass on
the same freedoms to the recipients.  You must make sure that they receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensor" means the
  individual, individuals, or entity that is granting you the rights under
  this License.

1. You may copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even
   commercially, as long as you follow the terms of this license.

2. You must release the source code of your work and any modified
   versions under this license if you distribute the software.

3. You may not impose any additional restrictions on the rights
   granted by this license.

4. You must keep the license text and any copyright notices intact.
   
5. When you distribute the program (either in original or modified form),
   you must make sure that users have access to the source code. This means
   that you must either distribute the source code, or offer a written offer
   to provide the source code for no more than the cost of distribution.

6. If you modify the program and distribute it, you must state that you have
   changed the program, and the date of the change.

7. If you include a modified version of the program in your project, your
   project must be licensed under the GPL.

8. If you distribute the software, you must ensure that everyone who
   receives a copy of the program also receives the same rights under
   this license.

9. The GNU General Public License does not grant permission to use the
   trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
   Licensor, except as required for describing the origin of the Program
   and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

10. You are not required to use the GPL for your own private use of the
    program, but if you distribute the software or derivative works,
    you must comply with the GPL.

11. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER: The Program is licensed "as is", without any
    warranty of any kind. You can’t hold the authors or copyright holders
    responsible for any damages caused by using the program.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs:

If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible
benefit to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to your program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
information to the users.

    [Program Name] is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    [Program Name] is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
